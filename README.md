# Interpretable Multi-Level Liver Cirrhosis Classification Using a Boosting-based Stacking Ensemble Method.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust and interpretable model for the early detection of liver cirrhosis, a condition that significantly impacts public health. The model leverages a stacking ensemble method, combining multiple base models and a meta-learner to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.

# Key Components
Base Models: Implemented using the following algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that predicts based on the closest training examples.
Random Forest: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space.
Gradient Boosting: A boosting technique that builds models sequentially, each correcting the errors of its predecessor.
Meta-Learner: Utilized XGBoost for boosting, which effectively handles overfitting and improves generalization by combining the outputs of base models.

Data Processing
# Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and addressed inconsistencies in the dataset.
Normalization: Scaled features to ensure uniformity and improve the performance of distance-based algorithms.
Feature Engineering: Created new features based on domain knowledge to enhance model performance.
Encoding: Transformed categorical variables into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Training and Testing:

Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.
Cross-Validation: Applied k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics:

Precision and Recall: Evaluated to measure the modelâ€™s accuracy and ability to identify true positives and negatives.
ROC AUC Curve: Assessed the model's capability to distinguish between classes across various thresholds.
Visualization:

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Applied for dimensionality reduction and to visualize high-dimensional data.
Seaborn: Used for advanced data visualization to explore and understand data distributions and model performance.
Interpretability:

Implemented LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide interpretability and explain the predictions of the complex ensemble model.
Achievements
# Prediction Accuracy: 
Achieved over 99.5% accuracy, demonstrating the model's exceptional performance in liver cirrhosis classification.
